# Day 39 KNN Imputation

Today is 4th May, 2025 Sunday and I learnt KNN Imputation. This technique is mostly used to ML algorithm called KNN where K is the number of nearest neighbors.
In KNN Imputation, we calculate Nan Euclidean Distance to fill missing values. This distance is specified to fill missing values actually.
We have to specify numer of closest neighbors with the help of which we fill missing values.
Formula to calculate nan euclidean distance is:
**dist(x,y) = sqrt(weight*sq.distance from present coordinates)**,
*where*,
**weight = (Total number of coordinates)/(number of present coordinates)**

### Advatnages:
It's fast and give accurate results.

### Disadvantages:
We have to do more calculation. So it will take more time on large datasets
During Deployment we will need to upload training dataset too. So, it's memory consuming as well.
So, it's better for smaller datasets.

## Code:
We can specify neighbors and weights in knn imputer, which are by default 5 and uniform respectively.
