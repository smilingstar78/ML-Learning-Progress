## 📖 What is PCA?

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a statistical technique that simplifies high-dimensional data by projecting it into a lower-dimensional space.

### 💡 Why use PCA?

- 🧹 Remove redundancy from features
- ⚡ Speed up machine learning models
- 🧠 Easier to visualize complex datasets
- 🔍 Uncover hidden patterns

## 🔍 How PCA Works (in simple words):

1. **Standardize the data**  
   PCA is sensitive to scale, so features are standardized (mean = 0, std = 1).

2. **Compute covariance matrix**  
   Shows how variables relate to each other.

3. **Calculate eigenvectors & eigenvalues**  
   These help identify the “directions” (principal components) where the data varies the most.

4. **Sort components**  
   Keep the ones that explain the most variance.

5. **Project data**  
   Original data is transformed into the new feature space (fewer dimensions).

## ⚠️ When Not to Use PCA (Limitations)

- If interpretability of individual features is crucial
- For non-linear datasets (use t-SNE or UMAP instead)
- If number of components > number of features ➡️ **Error!**
- On unscaled data ➡️ Bad results
