# Day 42 Outlier Detection with Z Score Technique

This is 6th May, 2025 Tuesday and Today I learnt about outliers and one technique of how to detect them and two techniques of how to handle them.

## What are Outliers?
Outliers are basically those datapoints in our data that does not behave normally like all other points. So sometimes they are good like in anomaly detection but mostly they are bad and dangerous.

## Z Score
To detect them I learnt about Z score technique, Where we calculate lowest limit and highest limit value. Beyound these limits the data is oitlier.
But for this technique, the data should be normally distributed.

## Techniques to Handle Outliers
#### 1. Trimming:
To remove rows containing outliers but it will cause problems if more data contains outlier.
#### 2. Capping:
To cap outliers. Means value less than lowest limit should be given value of lowest limit
and values higher than highest limit should be given value of highest limit.

That's it. You can check my code file in this repository **Day_42.ipynb**.
