## Day 43 Outlier Detection and Removal using the IQR Method
Today is 7th May, 2025 Wednesday and Today I learnt about a new method of detecting outliers.

This IQR Technique is only used for data that is either positive skewed or negative skewed. We work with percentiles here, Calculating IQR then 25th and 75th Percentile to calculate upper and lower limit.

After that any data point beyond upper and lower limit is considered an outlier and is either removed with the help of trimming or is capped, depending on the data.
You can get refrence from my code note book named DAY_43.ipynb in this repository.
