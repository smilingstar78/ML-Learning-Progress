# 📊 Days 48–50: Regression Models in Machine Learning

Welcome to my mini-regression project from **Days 48 to 50** of my **100 Days of Machine Learning Journey**!  
In this module, I explored both **Simple** and **Multiple Linear Regression**, evaluated model performance using **regression metrics**, implemented algorithms **from scratch**, and practiced on **real datasets**.

## 🚀 What I Learned

### 🔹 Day 48 – Part I & II
- Introduction to **Simple Linear Regression**
- Mathematical foundation: cost function, gradients, line equation
- Implemented the algorithm **from scratch using Python**
- Applied the model on real datasets for hands-on experience

### 🔹 Day 49
- Explored and compared **regression evaluation metrics**:
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
- Learned to **visualize predictions** and understand model accuracy

### 🔹 Day 50 – Part I, II & III
- Introduction to **Multiple Linear Regression**
- Linear Algebra behind multiple features (Matrix operations 🧠)
- Designed a custom **Regression class** that:
  - Handles both simple and multiple regression
  - Computes predictions and evaluates performance
- Practiced with real-world datasets to reinforce concepts
