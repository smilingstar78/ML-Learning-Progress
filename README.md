# 🌟 Muskan's Machine Learning Journey

Hey there! 👋 I'm Muskan (aka [ai_enthusiast86](https://github.com/ai-enthusiast86)) and this is my personal repo where I’m documenting my **Machine Learning learning journey** — one day at a time 💻✨

## 📅 Daily Progress Logs

This repo contains my daily notes, code snippets, and thoughts as I explore the magical world of ML.  
Each day is like a level-up — from missing values to model tuning 💪

### ✅ Topics Covered So Far:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 🧼
- Mean & Median Imputation 🧮
- Handling Missing Values 📉
- Data Visualization 📊
- Feature Scaling 🔍
- Regression Basics 📈
- And more coming soon... 🚀

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries I’m Using

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy 📊
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 📈
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- Jupyter Notebooks 📓
- VS Code / Colab 💻

## 📌 My Goals

- 💡 Understand core ML concepts (and not just use fancy libraries)
- 🧠 Build strong intuition for data
- 🛠️ Work on real-world projects (slowly but surely!)
- 📈 Share my progress on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muskan-tariq-095a50282) & [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ai_enthusiast86)
