# 🧠 Day 45 - Learning Log

Today is 9th May, 2025 Friday and today I learned two super important concepts in Machine Learning:

## 📌 1. Feature Construction
Also called **Feature Engineering**, this is all about:
- Creating **new features** from the existing data to **help the model understand** the problem better.
- Making raw data more **informative** and **usable**.

### ✨ Examples:
- From a `Name` column ➝ I extracted titles like **Mr**, **Miss**, **Dr**, etc.
- From a `Cabin` column ➝ I pulled out the deck letter.
- From a `Date` column ➝ I made new features like **Day**, **Month**, or **Weekday**.

These little tweaks can make a *huge* difference in how well a model performs!

## ✂️ 2. Feature Splitting (Train-Test Split)
This is when we **divide our dataset** into two parts:
- **Training Set** ➝ to teach the model
- **Testing Set** ➝ to check how well it learned

You can see all this in my DAY_45.IPYNB file in ths same repository.
